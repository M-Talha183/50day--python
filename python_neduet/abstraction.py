Question 1:

Create an Abstract class Shape with an abstract method
calculateArea() that can be implemented by any subclass.
Make 2 sub classes of the above class Square and Circle
each having 2 instant variables for calculating the 
area.

Question 2:

Create a Parent Abstract class with an abstract, 
method that can be implemented by any subclass,
used in calculating the cost of appliance.
Make 2 sub classes for each appliance of the above 
abstract class each having their own instant 
variables for calculating thier total_cost(Price).
