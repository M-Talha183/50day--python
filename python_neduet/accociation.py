"""
Relationships in OOP:
1) Inheritence ("is-a" relationship)
2) Association ("has-a" relationship)

is-a Relationship:
    -used when one class is specialized version of another class
    -modeled using inheritance
    Eg: *A Dog "is-a" Animal ---> dog class inherits from animal class
        *A Car  "is-a" Vehicle ---> car class inherits from vehicle class

has-a Relationship:
    -represents complete + partial ownership (association) b/w classes
    - modelled using aggregation and composition --> association
    - possession of one object by another
    Eg: *A Car "has-a" Engine --> Engine is possessed by a car completely
        *A library "has-a" Books  --> Books are possessed by Library

Association: connection/possession/dependency b/w two classes is association.
    Eg: Person has an address, name etc. But person is not a address etc.
Categories of Association:
    -Aggregation
    -Composition

#***Functions Decorators***
#Qus: Write a decorator log_function_call that logs the 
# name of the function and it's arguments each time the
# function is called.
# Example Outpt:
# Function Greet is called with 2 arguments ('Alice','Jackson')
# output -> "Hello, Alice Jackson!"
