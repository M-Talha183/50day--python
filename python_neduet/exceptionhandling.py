##Raising Custom Errors using raise keyword


"""
Qs: 1 Write  a program that handles the 
zero division error.
Hint: Take input from user any 2 numbers, 
operate them and handle the error


Qs:2 Handle file not found error

Qs:3 Write a program that takes input from user
and handles following:
1) The number shouldn't be neg
2) The error should be handled. 

Qs 4: Write a program that performs integer division. 
Handle all possible errors that may occur.

Qs: 5 Implement else clause with try and except. 
Hint: else executes if no exceptions are raised

Qs: 6 Write a program that
takes list as an input from user.
and calculates its sum.
Handle exceptions in this case.
