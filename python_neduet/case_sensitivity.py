'''Python is a case sensitive language.
Following are the 'donts' while declaring a 
variable
1) Variable name must not be a python's keyword.
For example: as, break, continue, for, in, and,
or, try, finally, except etc..
2) Vaiable name must not be starting with any
number. For example: '2_my_variable' 
is incorrect'''

# 5myvariable = 4

myvariable2 = 0
my_vars= 33

myName = "Talha"
myName = 5
print(myName)
# print(myName)
