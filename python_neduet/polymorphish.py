Thank you so much everyone for the beautiful token of appreciation, It was very very kind and sensible of all of you those who contributed and those who remained consistent throughout this 2 month long journey and didn't give up.

A/S Everyone! Kindly Pay Attention to Reading it:
I am writing it with an aim to encourage you all in our Programming journey uptil yet. I have felt most of you have lost momentum right after mid term and as soon as we started OOPs.

If for some reasons you think you couldn't do well in Mid Term, no worries let's move forward. Becasue the one who tries never Fails. So let's try again together. 

Just wanted to ensure all sort of guidance and assistance in understanding OOPs from our side, and we can have it sorted by giving a little more attention to concepts by re-understanding those once again.

Just Do The Following And Your Chances to get Certified as Python Developer will be marginally increased:

1) Remain Regular From Monday (30th Dec) onward to get certified. It is just 8-9 day long comittment. 
2) I'll be covering all OOPs this week, and will be helping you all in understanding old and new concepts individually.
3) From Monday we'll be actually practicing for finals, to get a good score in it, so all of you those who were regular before mid term, kindly do attend classes and Don't Give Up at this Point.. 

Do discuss your queries and concerns with me, if your are unable to understand any topic/ concept/ logic we can have it sorted. 

Lastly, if you can aim it, you can do it!!

Regrads, 
Areeba Jamshed.
